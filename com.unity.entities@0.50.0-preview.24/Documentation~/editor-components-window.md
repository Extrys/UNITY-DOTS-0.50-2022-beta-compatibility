# Components window reference

The Components window displays a list of C# [Component types](ecs_components) that Unity has loaded across all assemblies and packages. Use the search bar to find Components, and select them to see more information about them in the Component Inspector.

To open the Components window, go to **Window &gt; DOTS &gt; Components**. 

Use the search bar to find Components, and select a Component to see its details in the Component [Inspector](editor-inspectors.md). This window is a useful way to find and investigate the Components in your project. For more information about inspecting Components, see the [Component Inspector reference](editor-component-inspector.md) documentation.
