# Working in the Editor

You can view information about the ECS elements in your project in Entities-specific Editor windows. The documentation in this section of the manual outlines the windows, Inspectors, and workflows available in the Editor.

To better navigate between Entities, Components, and Systems, the following Editor windows and Inspectors are available:

* [Archetypes window](editor-archetypes-window.md)
* [Component Inspector](editor-component-inspector.md)
* [Components window](editor-components-window.md)
* [DOTS Hierarchy window](editor-hierarchy-window.md)
* [Entity Inspector](editor-entity-inspector.md)
* [System Inspector](editor-system-inspector.md)
* [Systems window](editor-systems-window.md)
* [Query window](editor-query-window.md)
