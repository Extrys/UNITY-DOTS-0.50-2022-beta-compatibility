# Entities Inspectors

The [Inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) displays detailed information about an Entity, System or Component you select in the Editor. This section of the documentation contains information about the following Inspectors:

* [Component Inspector](editor-component-inspector.md)
* [Entity Inspector](editor-entity-inspector.md)
* [System Inspector](editor-system-inspector.md)

It also describes the [Query window](editor-query-window.md), which you access from the **Relationship** tab of an Inspector.
