# About Unity Profiling Core
Use the Unity Profiling Core package to add contextual information to the [Unity Profiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Profiler.html) captures. You can use the [Scripting APIs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.profiling.core@latest?subfolder=/api/index.html) provided with the Unity Profiling Core package to add a string or number to a Profiler sample or pass custom data to the Profiler data stream to later use in the Editor.

## Preview package
This package is available as a preview, so it is not ready for production use. The features and documentation in this package might change before it is verified for release.

## Installation
To install this package, follow the instructions in the [Package Manager documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-install.html). The Unity Profiling Core package is not discoverable in the Package Manager UI because it is a core package. Therefore the recommended installation method is to [add the package by name](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-quick.html), which is `com.unity.profiling.core`.
